# docker_best_practices

Docker best practices are essential for building efficient, secure, and 
maintainable containers. This repository is an example of the best 
practices to follow while working with docker.

## Usage

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 
and [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.54/getting-started/installation/) 
first.

Clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmadalsajid/docker_best_practices.git
```

go to `docker_best_practices` directory and create a `.env` file with the below
environment variables

```
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
MONGO_DB_NAME=school
MONGO_DB_COLLECTION=students
MONGO_USER_USERNAME=school_admin
MONGO_USER_PASSWORD=password
MONGODB_URL="mongodb://${MONGO_USER_USERNAME}:${MONGO_USER_PASSWORD}@mongo:27017/${MONGO_DB_NAME}?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

Lastly, start all the containers using [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

```
$ docker compose up
```

Here are some key practices that you can match up with the configurations:

### 1. Use Official Base Images

* Start with official or well-maintained images as your base to ensure you get
  security updates and community support.

### 2. Minimize Image Size

* Use a minimal base image like alpine or distroless.
* Remove unnecessary files and dependencies.
* Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image small.

### 3. Leverage .dockerignore

* Use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories (e.g.,
  local dependencies, build artifacts) from the build context.

### 4. Use Multi-Stage Builds

* This allows you to separate the build and runtime environments, resulting in
  a smaller, cleaner final image.

### 5. Avoid Running Containers as Root

* For security, avoid running your application as the root user. Use the USER
  instruction to specify a non-root user.

### 6. Layer Caching

* Order instructions to optimize Docker's layer caching, which can
  significantly speed up rebuilds.

### 7. Keep Containers Stateless

* Containers should be ephemeral and stateless. Use volumes for persistent
  data and ensure that the container can be recreated at any time without
  data loss.

### 8. Environment Variables

* Use environment variables for configuration settings to keep your
  Dockerfiles flexible and avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

### 9. Health Checks

* Define health checks in your Dockerfile using the HEALTHCHECK instruction
  to monitor the status of your running containers.

### 10. Use Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications

* Use docker-compose for managing multi-container applications, enabling easier
  configuration and orchestration.

### 11. Regularly Update Base Images

* Regularly update your base images to the latest versions to incorporate
  security patches and updates.

### 12. Use Tags for Versioning

* Use specific tags (e.g., :1.0, :latest) to version your images, avoiding
  the latest tag in production for better control.

### 13. Log to stdout/stderr

* Configure your application to log in to stdout and stderr so that Docker
  can capture logs correctly.

### 14. Optimize Networking

* Use Docker networks wisely to isolate different parts of your application,
  improving security and reducing the risk of cross-container communication
  issues.

### 15. Handle Signals Correctly

* Ensure your application correctly handles Unix signals (e.g., SIGTERM) to
  allow for graceful shutdowns.

### 16. Use Build Arguments for Build-Time Variables

* Use ARG in your Dockerfile to pass variables at build time, and avoid using
  ENV for sensitive information.

### 17. Automate and Test Builds

* Use CI/CD pipelines to automate Docker image builds, and test your images
  regularly to ensure they function as expected.

### 18. Security Scanning

* Regularly scan your images for vulnerabilities using tools like `Trivy`
  or `Clair`.

### 19. Limit Image Layers

* Combine multiple commands into one RUN instruction where possible to reduce
  the number of layers in your image.

### 20. Use Named Volumes and Networks

* Use named volumes and networks in docker-compose or Docker commands to
  persist data across container restarts and manage connectivity.

### 21. Document Your Dockerfiles

* Provide comments and documentation within your Dockerfile to explain the
  purpose of each command.

### 22. Avoid Hardcoding Values

* Use build arguments, environment variables, and external configuration files
  to keep your Dockerfile flexible and reusable across different environments.

## Why Use Docker Best Practices?

* **Efficiency**: Best practices help you create optimized Docker images that
  are smaller, faster, and easier to manage.
* **Security**: Following best practices minimizes vulnerabilities and enhances
  the security of your containers.
* **Maintainability**: Well-structured and documented Dockerfiles are easier to
  maintain, update, and troubleshoot.
* **Scalability**: Stateless containers and proper networking practices ensure
  that your applications can scale efficiently.
* **Consistency**: Automation and versioning practices ensure consistent builds
  and deployments, reducing the risk of errors.
* **Compliance**: Adhering to these practices helps ensure that your containers
  comply with industry standards and best practices for software development
  and deployment.

By implementing these best practices, you ensure that your Docker containers are robust, secure, and ready for
production use.
